Deadlines Summary
=================


Thew deadlines are counted backwards from the release date so that every phase
has a consistent amount of time each month.  The declaration of intentions is 
the expception and is always on the 1st of the month.

DECLARATION OF INTENTIONS
1st - declaration of intentions

3 Days before GeneBuild handover  (pseudo-deadline)
  By this time core dbs should be somewaht ready for id-mapping and
  peptide dumps

GENEBUILD HANDOVER to Core/Compara
5 Working days before Core handover  (~13-15th)
  core-like dbs, snp, vega should be ready to copy over ecs2d
  ready meaning, gene_build complete
  stabel_id and id-mapping done
  protein annotation and mapping done


CORE/COMPARA HANDOVER to Mart/Webteam
5 Working days before Mart handover, (7 before release ~20th)

MART HANDOVER to Webteam
2 Working days before release (~28th)                                          

RELEASE - 
1st of the next month or the following Monday if the 1st is on a Friday, 
Saturday, or Sunday (webteam do not release on Fridays).
    


Main steps in release coordination
==================================

* A- on the 1st of the month previous to release send a mail with
  subject like "July release: declaration of intention", asking people
  to declare what are the new databases and schema changes expected.

* B- Ask the martians to copy from ecs2d over to ecs2f the old dbs. When
  they acknoledge that is done, you can drop from ecs2d all the old dbs
  (use drop database command in a MySQL client, never do a rm -rf as
  mysqlens user). Do not delete database like ensembl_% and with
  %_expression_% in their name.

* C- Based on the synthesis of what is new coming, you can decide what are
  the databases that will not change, and can copy their latest version
  from ecs3d using ensembl/scritps/CopyDBoverServer.pl scripts, -h gives
  you an idea how to use it.
  You have to run it as mysqlens user.

* D- keep a tight contact with the persons involved in the production of
  new data, i.e.
  Yuan for snp,
  Laura for worm dbs,
  Val for mammalian dbs,
  Manu for insect dbs,
  Kertin for Zebrafish,
  Stephen for vega,
  Abel/Cara for compara/family...

Send them a mail from time to time, to see how things are going.

From time to time ask James Smith to run lite in the corresponding 

* E- On the Genebuild handover date all dbs but compara/family are expected 
to be ready and copied over to ecs2d.

* F- Set up a web test server on ecs2d port 5000. When done, send a mail
  to ensembl-admin to ask everyone concerned to check the display of
  his/her data on the web.

To set up a web server, you will have to do it as ***REMOVED*** unix user,
if not already set up.
The default machine and port to run it are ecs2d port 5000

You will have to created a 

su ensembl
mkdir /nfs/acari/websites/ensembl_ecs2d_port5000
cd /nfs/acari/websites/ensembl_ecs2d_port5000
cvs -d :ext:ensembl@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/nfs/ensembl/cvsroot co sanger-web
cvs -d :ext:ensembl@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/nfs/ensembl/cvsroot co ensembl
cvs -d :ext:ensembl@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/nfs/ensembl/cvsroot co ensembl-external
cvs -d :ext:ensembl@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/nfs/ensembl/cvsroot co ensembl-compara

ensembl-lite is not needed unless you want to run lite scripts and
build lite dbs yourself. At the moment, you will need to ask James
Smith to do it.

get the latest stable bioperl version (see
http://www.bioperl.org/Core/Latest/index.shtml)

setenv http_proxy "http://wwwcache.sanger.ac.uk:3128" (to make wget work)
wget http://bioperl.org/DIST/bioperl-1.2.1.tar.gz
gtar xvzf bioperl-1.2.1.tar.gz
rm -f bioperl-1.2.1.tar.gz
ln -s bioperl-1.2.1 bioperl-live (that is to comply with @INC set up
in conf/httpd.conf file)

mkdir logs (needed for webserver logs)

if /nfs/acari/websites/ensembl_ecs2d_port5000 already exists, running
a cvs up -dP should be enough. The bioperl version already installed
would work.

Modify some conf files.

cd conf

Files to be modifyied would be 
MULTI.ini
 indicates the name of the multispecies dbs

DEFAULTS.ini
 update the following variables if not already done
 ENSEMBL_HOST            = ecs2d
 ENSEMBL_HOST_PORT       = 3306
 ENSEMBL_WRITE_USER      = ecs2dadmin
 ENSEMBL_WRITE_PASS      = xxxx

SiteDefs.pm
 update the following variables if not already done
 $ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT     = '/nfs/acari/websites/ensembl_ecs2d_port5000';
 $ENSEMBL_PORT           = '5000';
 $ENSEMBL_USER           = ***REMOVED***;
 $ENSEMBL_ERRORS_TO      = 'abel@ebi.ac.uk';

Homo_sapiens.ini
 update the following variables if not already done
 ENSEMBL_GOLDEN_PATH     = NCBI31
 ENSEMBL_DB              = homo_sapiens_core_14_31
 ENSEMBL_DISEASE         = homo_sapiens_disease_14_31
 ENSEMBL_EST             = homo_sapiens_est_14_31
 ENSEMBL_ESTGENE         = homo_sapiens_estgene_14_31
 ENSEMBL_FASTA           = homo_sapiens_fasta_14_31
 ENSEMBL_HAPLOTYPE       = homo_sapiens_haplotype_14_31
 ENSEMBL_LITE            = homo_sapiens_lite_14_31
 ENSEMBL_VEGA            = homo_sapiens_vega_14_31
 ENSEMBL_SNP             = homo_sapiens_snp_14_31

ad so one for species to be served Mus_musculus.ini,
Rattus_norvegicus.ini, etc...

As Mart is not used, I use to comment 2 lines in perl.startup script
#use MartDefs;
[...]
# MartDefs->new();

Modify httpd start and stop scripts

cd ../ctrl_scripts

in start_ensembl script
change from 
 /ensweb/wwwdev/server/src/httpd -d /ensweb/wwwdev/server
to
 /usr/local/ensembl/apache/bin/httpd -d /nfs/acari/websites/ensembl_ecs2d_port5000

in stop_ensembl script
change from 
 kill -TERM `cat /ensweb/wwwdev/server/logs/$HOSTNAME.httpd.pid`
to
 kill -TERM `cat /nfs/acari/websites/ensembl_ecs2d_port5000/logs/$HOSTNAME.httpd.pid`

Then start the server

./start_ensembl

That will go through all the conf files and created a
conf/config.packed. The latter is used for quick start of the
server. If you change a conf files, you will need to delete this file
before the start of httpd. In this way, it will take in account the
new changes.

to stop it

./stop_ensembl


* G- Ask the release core assistant to run health check suite and to
  update schema if needed. To advertise any inconsistancy in the dbs,
  and fix or arrange someone to fix them. 

* H- Run a healthcheck again just before handover (checking things
  we had done before plus new things that have been added during the data
  shakedown) - if possible of course

* I- By the Core/Compara handover date if everything is fine, send a mail to
hand-over the dbs, listing all dbs, specifying what are the new data coming in,
the schema changes, and a summary of mart translation (that can be
obtained from the martians). Mention there that the mart db is
expected 3 working days after the handover.

Here is an example,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

The 39 databases listed below are ready for collection on ecs2d.
That does not include ensembl_mart_14_1, as from now on, the mart database 
hand-over to the web team has its own dead-line.

The ensembl June edition contains 9 species. Here the details of new data,

* It should have been a new FPC map for mouse core..., but I forgot to 
remind this to Tim until this morning. Partly my fault then. He 
suppose to work on it by now and will provide the data file to James Smith 
directly who will load the data in....Tim, James, is that right?

* New assembly/gene_build/estgenes for Zebrafish
* New estgene db for human

* New SNP dbs for mosquito based on dbSNP114

* New human ensembl vega database in sync with vega.sanger.ac.uk released 
  on May 12th.

* New protein family database including now Zebrafish Ensembl proteins. 
  All families have their multiple alignment stored, but the first 7 largest 
  families. I still did not have time to investigate/try the solution 
  proposed by Tony to maybe solve the pb.

* New compara database, with additional subset of DNA/DNA alignments 
  focused on highly conserved regions, for human/mouse, human/rat, mouse/rat 
  and elegans/briggsae.
  Homologous gene pairs included now Zebrafish Ensembl proteins compared to 
  human, mouse, rat and fugu.

Schema changes
==============

Core
----
Addition of tables to better support archived old peptides

(1) Added 'peptide_archive' table
	translation_stable_id
	translation_version
 	peptide_seq

(2) Added 'gene_archive' table
	gene_stable_id
	gene_version
	transcript_stable_id
	transcript_version
	translation_stable_id
	translation_version
	mapping_session_id

The versions were added to the stable_id_event table to allow better
tracking

(3) Added 'stable_id_event' table added
	old_stable_id
	old_version # new column
	new_stable_id
	new_version # new column
	mapping_session_id

(4) Altered 'analysis' table
    column parameters was enlarged from varchar(80) 
    to varchar(255).

(5) Altered mapfrag table
    column type enum got two more members

(6) We allow versions of stable_ids  to be NULL throughout the system for
    ids we produced before we started versioning.

Compara
-------
Various changes occured in several tables to allow the possibility to 
distinguish between different kind of DNA/DNA alignments implicating the 
same 2 species

(7) Altered method_link table
    changed colunm name from 'method_link_type' to 'type' and change it
    from varchar(10) to varchar(50)
(8) Altered method_link_species table
    added colunm 'species_set' int(10)
(9) Altered genomic_align_genome table
    added colunm 'method_link_id' as FK from method_link table
(10) Altered genomic_align_block table
     added colunm 'method_link_id' as FK from method_link table


Any other schema changes that I would have missed?

Regards,

Abel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* I- Even if by this date, the main part of your work is over, you will
  still need to follow mail about dbs problems take some decision
  together with the web team to fix them.

* K- By the day of release, organise a post-mortem meeting to list what
  were the problem during the release, propose/ask for possibles
  solutions/improvements for the next release.
  The main persons to be there should be Jim, James, Arne, Graham, Arek,
  Abel, Val, Ewan and Michele. I found out that find the right day and time to have
  most of those people together has been the most complicated task. You
  will have to organize that in morning as Val is working part time.

* L- send a email minute to ensembl-admin to summarize what was discussed/decided during
  post-mortem.
