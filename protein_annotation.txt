Protein Annotation

I-History
We were used to run all of the protein annotation by hands which would
involve loosing jobs, make mistakes,...
Moreover more and more annotation came into Ensembl and more and more organism
The pipeline used for DNA annotation has been thought to provide a reliable
way of running an annotation over the whole proteome.
But one problem has been raised, we planned to do the annotation at the
logical unit which would be the peptide, but some algorythms are so fast
that it would be a waste of CPU to run for one peptide at a time on the
pipeline. For example the only way of runnning seq would be to run it over
the entire proteome.

II-Different annotations
A-Domains Annotation
+ProfileScan
+ScanProsite (checked with emotifs)
+Prints
+Pfam
+Superfamily (coming)

B-Other annotations
+Coils
+Seg (low complexity)
+Tmhmm (transmembrane)
+Sigp

III-Description
This script will submit run_protein_RunnableDB
    This is the script which is used to run the full protein analysis. The protein analysis is specific in a way that\'s the algorithms used have different speed. For example the difference of speed between hmmpfam and low complexity is huge. Moreover the analysis is done at the peptide level (much less material than for a whole).
    There is then 3 ways of running an annotation:
    + The classical way, protein by protein (used for hmmpfam for example)
    + The intermediate way, using chunks of the main peptide file. For example using chunks containing 100 peptides in fasta format (used for PRINTS for example).
    + All against all. Uses a file containing all the peptide (used for low complexity for example)

IV-How to run the protein pipeline
You need first to install all of the binaries, databases you need in a place which is going to be visible from everywhere on the cluster.
Then you need to fill in the following configuration file:
Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Prot_analysis_Conf.pl
This should be self explanatory.
then run:
perl submit_prot_analysis.pl
in script/protein_pipeline/

V-Errors handling
There is no robust ways of checking for errors. A directory for each annotation is written in the scratch area. The best way is to grep for exception:
grep -i EXC *
