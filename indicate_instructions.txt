Another index system: INDICATE (by Steve Searle)

	First of all you need to be able to use some libraries:
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /nfs/acari/searle/progs/local2/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

	There is a program:
	/nfs/acari/searle/progs/ensembl/ensembl-nci/src/bioglib/program/indicate

	which creates the OBDA indexes.

	Example usage

	1. Make a directory for the index
	mkdir dbSTS

	2. Run:

	/nfs/acari/searle/progs/ensembl/ensembl-nci/src/bioglib/program/indicate
	--data_dir /data/blastdb/Ensembl --file_prefix dbSTS- --index dbSTS
	--parser dbParser

	Where:
	--data_dir is directory contain fasta files to index
	--file_prefix is prefix of files to index (all files beginning with
	  prefix and ending in a number will be indexed). If you want to index a single
	  fasta file you can write here just the name of that file
	--index directory created in step 1
	--parser parser function to use (dbParser for db* databases,
	  swallParser for swall, rikenParser for riken,... )
	  ( if you only have 1-word display_ids in a multiple-entry fasta file
	  the parser to use is 'singleWordParser')


	The seqfetcher to use with this index is Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::SeeFetcher::OBDAIndexSeqFetcher.pm
	make sure that it is correctly defined in your Runnables

	You'll also need to use Bioperl 1 to be abkle to use OBDAIndex
