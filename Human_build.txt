A. Data sources:
================

Protein: 
--------

* Swissprot human set

- where they can be found - additional files

# Swissprot varsplic...  Needs to be mentioned.
You need to generate this yerself.


* Refseq human set

# Be totally suspicious about the refseq datafiles.  They change, they get half updated, things are missing.  Check them against previous files.  Check the NCBI refseq web site (even after you have downloaded your files and run your pmatches), read their READMEs - be vigilant. #



cDNA:
-----
The following two files are those routinely used for assembling the cDNA build set.  Note that not all the Homo sapiens sequences in these files are appropriate for gene building.

* embl_vertrna --  /data/blastdb/Ensembl/embl_vertrna-1

This file is generated by Hans from the data resources he manages.  The sequences should be non-redundant and free of things such as ESTs.  We take this file and filter on the basis of species.  The script that does this is ensembl-pipeline/scripts/EST/get_human_ests.pl - this is not a purpose designed script and hence much of this script is not relevant for the cDNAs and either needs to be turned off or not invoked.  As of April 04 this script contains code for junking and sequences that have certain annotation in their description line - you probably want to comment out most of this code.  At this stage poly-A/T clipping and sequence quality filtering goes on.  Some of the Homo sapiens sequences are discarded by the filters - this may suprise anybody externally using this file on the farm who wants the whole set.

*  Refseqs -- ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.rna.fna.gz

This is a difficult file to handle and needs to treated with suspicion.  Invest some time digging around the refseq web and ftp sites to see what might have been changed since previous releases.  Notably, automated predictions have been included since Feb 04 and these are not good data for basing further automated predictions.  Manually check what is in the downloadable files - docs on the NCBI site explain what the different sequence id prefixes mean.  The May 04 release only used NM_ prefixed sequences.

EST:
----

dbEST human entries



Xref ID Mapping resources:
--------------------------

Check that you can get these at the beginning of the build, not in the final days.  Sometimes they need to be generated afresh.

Esp. GKB files need to be made by Imre/Esther/Bijay



B. Problems with past builds:
