Proteins 
========

Building genes on the human genome benefits from a gloriously rich set of sequences that can be used as evidence.  Hence, for the Pmatch/TargettedGenewise part of the annotation process there is no real need to include sequences other than those from Homo sapiens.

A) Swissprot human proteins
---------------------------

Have a look for the file:

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/SPproteomes/fasta_files/proteomes/9606.FASTAC

The swissprot folks store organism specific data files according to their NCBI taxonomic id - 9606 means Homo sapiens.  

You might notice there is another special file in this directory called 9606.SPEns.FASTAC.  You certainly don't want to pick up this file by mistake.  This file contains the 'human proteome set' which is largely based on ensembl protein predictions combined with any missing swissprot entries.  It would not be good to use this as a starting set for another round of annotation.  One of these files also exists for the mouse.  For more information on these files check the README file in the swissprot ftp data directory.

Indeed, it is always appropriate to have at least a quick look in the README file (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/SPproteomes/README) associated with this directory.  A quick check here might alert you to recent changes in the data format (which are usually explicitly described) since the last build - and help avoid messy problems further downstream.

While you are performing this download it is easy to also pick up the file:

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/SPproteomes/swissprot_files/proteomes/9606.SPC

This will be needed later in the protein xref id mapping procedure.

*** IMPORTANT: Swissprot alternative splice variants ***

The feature table of a swissprot entry contains information that can be used to generate protein variants generated by alternative splicing.  The swissprot protein data set can hence be expanded to include an amino acid sequence for each splice variant.  Use of this expanded data source is now pretty much a compulsory part of the human gene build.  The process to create the expanded protein set is easy-ish and uses a perl script available from:

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/swissprot/varsplic/varsplic.pl

The script includes internal documentation on its usage. In addition, the download directory includes a detailed README which explains the logic of the process of creating alternative splice forms from a swissprot entry.  The script requires that the Swissprot Perl module Swissknife.pm in your $PERL5LIB path.  This module and its documentation are available at:

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/swissprot/Swissknife/


B) Refseq human proteins
------------------------

The whole build process ultimately uses both the amino acid and nucleotide refseq files, hence you may as well grab both at the same time (see cDNA data sources below).  The amino acid sequences are found at:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.protein.faa.gz

As also mentioned in the cDNA section, the contents of the refseq download files are not unchanging from release to release.  Hence make sure to read the README files associated with the refseq ftp directory (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq).  It is definitely also worth reading and re-reading the refseq web page documents (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/).  Little things change from time to time and it is important that a check is made that these input files don't contain certain sequence types that may perturb the build.  In particular be vigilant for proteins derived from automated annotation - these should not be allowed to become evidence for our predictions for obvious reasons.  Especially look out for sequences with XP_ prefixes - these have to be removed.  Check what the other id prefixes in the file mean and consider whether they are worth keeping.
It is highly likely that older versions of this file are lurking about on the farm - perform a quick comparison of the old and new files (eg. count sequences, grep the description lines from different parts of the file and manually skim the contents for any surprises).  This is all pretty paranoid, but this is a phase of the build where a bit of healthy suspicion will pay off.


cDNAs
=====

The following two files are those routinely used for assembling the cDNA build set.  Note that not all the Homo sapiens sequences in these files are appropriate for gene building.

* embl_vertrna --  /data/blastdb/Ensembl/embl_vertrna-1

This file is generated by Hans from the data resources he manages.  The sequences should be non-redundant and free of things such as ESTs.  We take this file and filter on the basis of species.  The script that does this is ensembl-pipeline/scripts/EST/get_human_ests.pl - this is not a purpose designed script and hence much of this script is not relevant for the cDNAs and either needs to be turned off or not invoked.  As of April 04 this script contains code for junking and sequences that have certain annotation in their description line - you probably want to comment out most of this code.  At this stage poly-A/T clipping and sequence quality filtering goes on.  Some of the Homo sapiens sequences are discarded by the filters - this may suprise anybody externally using this file on the farm who wants the whole set.

* Refseqs -- ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.rna.fna.gz

This is a difficult file to handle and needs to treated with suspicion.  Invest some time digging around the refseq web and ftp sites to see what might have been changed since previous releases.  Notably, automated predictions have been included since Feb 04 and these are not good data for basing further automated predictions.  Manually check what is in the downloadable files - docs on the NCBI site explain what the different sequence id prefixes mean.  The May 04 release only used NM_ prefixed sequences.

ESTs
====

dbEST human entries
-------------------

In principle the dbEST files along with READMEs are available from:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/dbEST/

However, these files are maintained on-site within the Sanger Institute and needn't be re-downloaded.  What is more, these are curated into files according to the organism that the sequences originate (another reason why it's good to have Hans around).  On most of the Sanger clusters these files live at:

/data/blastdb/Ensembl/

and are named dbHUMAN-EST-1 through to dbHUMAN-EST-5 (there are currently five files).  The result of this is that there is no need to have your own copy of these files at any time.  Simply point the EST extraction script (get_human_ests.pl) at these files _IN SERIAL_ and pipe the output to your own directory.  Try to avoid running the get_human_ests.pl script in parallel, as you may not be the only user of these files at the time.

The filtering of these ests as done by the get_human_ests.pl script is done with the assumption that lots of ests can be thrown out with little loss of data quality.  This is true for human est sets, but not so much for other organisms.  However, have a look inside the script to check that you agree with what the script is throwing away.  The script is also filtering on the basis of sequence quality.  This can be toggled in the script's command line options.  Dodgy sequences are unlikely to be placed by exonerate, but pre-filtering will mean that fewer sequences will have to be processed by later stages.


Protein Id Mapping Resources
============================

Check that you can get these at the beginning of the build, not in the final days.  Sometimes they need to be generated afresh.  This is especially true of the file that is needed for mapping Genome Knowledge Base ids.

D. Lessons learned from past builds:
====================================

Short-cuts and hacks
====================

* The human genome is 'known'
Compared to other organisms, so much effort has been spent looking at the human genome that in many cases the automated annotation can be readily checked against other data sources.  For example, the manual annotation is good for checking the quality of the automated annotation - especially in a scripted manner.  Also, the scientific literature is deep - via PubMed (which is at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) it is almost always possible to get independent corroboration of strange things you might find during the build (and oddball section of a chromosome, a gene with 100 copies of the same exon, etc, etc).  


Potentially surprising things
=============================

* Be suspicious of the assembly.
Your assembly is a fundamental part of your data-set.  Loading the assembly is an early part of the build process and hence mistake here can be propagated right through the whole process.  Take a little time to be paranoid about you assembly and primary sequence.  Dump the chromosomes and have a very close look at what you have.  As the assembly becomes more stable, diffs of the dumped chromosome sequence between releases might be useful for spotting things that might be awry.

* Human data overload.
Compared to other organisms, the size of data available for annotating the human genome is immense.  This means that the processes used for matching this data to the genome using blast, exonerate or whatever will take much longer for this organism than for others.  Sometimes the problem is manifest in subtle ways.  For example, there are lots of human ESTs and these are highly redundant.  While this means that many of the rarer transcripts are annotated by the EST gene build, there are regions of the genome where tens of thousands of ESTs are matched.  Successfully running some processes with this much data can be a headache in terms of CPU time/memory consumption. 

* Data resources.
Check early that the data resources that you need are available.  This is mainly important for the protein id mapping procedure.  As the protein mapping usually happens just before the database hand-over, there is no time to request the generation of external data files if they aren't already available.

* Build version
In the meta table the correct entry format for genebuild.version is YYMMOrganisation - as the human annotation is always done by us, the entry is of the format 0405Ensembl.
