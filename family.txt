The family database is an external database generated by running Enright
and Van Dongen's Tribe sequence clustering algorithm on a set of peptides
consisting of the EnsEMBL predictions, together with all vertebrate sequences
from SWISS-PROT and SP-TrEMBL. When the clusters have converged, a 'consensus
description' for the clusters is automatically generated from the SWISS-PROT
and TrEMBL description lines of the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL members of each
cluster. These consensus descriptions are also transferred to the EnsEMBL
gene descriptions in case there isn't one.
