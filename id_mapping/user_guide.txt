Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stable ID mapping process maps stable IDs for genes, exons, transcripts and
translations between databases. The original database is referred to as the
"source", the new database as the "target".

The process involves running a set of scripts which will read input from both
source and target dbs and generate tab-delimited data files (stable Id tables
and archive) which can option be uploaded into the target db. You will usually
run the wrapper script (called run.pl) which will wrap the whole process up and
also optionally submits the process to the farm via LSF.

The program has three modes:

  - normal: this will run the full stable Id mapping process.
  
  - upload: assuming that you earlier did a full run without uploading the
    results into the target db, this will upload the results from the dump files
    into the db.

  - check_only: this will only perform the initial consistency check and exit.

In addition to the result data, the stable Id mapping application also generates
a text summary of the mapping process, detailed mapping statistics, debug
output and logs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All scripts are in ensembl/misc-scripts/idmapping/. Paths in this document are
relative to this directory unless stated otherwise.

The Perl modules specific to the stable Id mapping are at
ensembl/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/IdMapping/.

Documentation is at ensembl-doc/id_mapping/.

All these files are kept in the Ensembl CVS repository. Scripts and modules are
in the "ensembl" CVS module, whereas the documentation is in the separate
"ensembl-doc" module.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the stable Id mapping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Configure:

  Make a copy of the default configuration (default.conf) and adapt it.

  Use the --conf option to use this configuration when you run the stable Id
  mapping. You can also override configuration parameters on the commandline.

  Please see the "Configuration parameters" section below for details.

2. Run it:

  To run the stable Id mapping, use the run.pl script. This script is a wrapper
  (and optional LSF dispatcher) for dump_cache.pl (which creates an object cache
  and serialises this data to files) and id_mapping.pl (which does the actual
  mapping).

  You can dispatch this script automatically to the farm by configuring your LSF
  options and then using the --lsf parameter. The script will then only do the
  initial checks locally and then re-exec itself with the same parameters on the
  farm.

  If you want to review your configuration before actually running the code, use
  the -i (--interactive) option.

3. Watch it run:

  Depending on your logging settings (see below), log output is either written
  directly to a file on lustre or nfs, so you can use `tail -f` to check
  the logs while the application runs, or output is temporarily written to a
  file in /tmp on the execution host, so you need to ssh into the host and tail
  the file there.

4. Check the results:

  All output will be in the 'basedir' you configured, separated into
  subdirectories. Look at summary_email.txt for an overview and at log/ for
  logs, stats/ for detailed stats and debug/ for debug output. If you want to
  manually upload results, the table data is in the tables/ directory.

  There is also a script called utils/compare_results.pl which will compare
  results from two different mapping runs (perl and java). This is mostly useful
  for debugging changes made to the code.

5. Run the healthchecks:

  There is an "id_mapping" healthcheck group which can be run to ensure all the
  stable ID and archive data is correct. 

  A typical example for running the healthchecks would be:

    $ ensj-healthcheck/run-healthcheck.sh -config ~/homo_sapiens.properties \
        -d homo_sapiens_core_49_36k -species homo_sapiens -type core id_mapping

  Please refer to the healthcheck documentation for further details.

5. Re-run from a checkpoint:

  If the stable Id mapping fails to whatever reason, fix the problem and then
  re-run it. At various points, checkpoint information is written to files and
  the script will automatically read this information and pick up execution from
  this checkpoint, rather than re-computing everything from scratch - if you
  deliberately want to do a clean new run, you'll have to delete the old output
  first (or configure a fresh basedir).

  If, for debugging purporses, you want to force a re-run from a particular
  checkpoint, you can do this by selectively removing the "checkpoint" files. A
  common scenario during code development is to run the application based on an
  existing object cache, and this is done by deleting all output but the cache/
  directory. for more elaborate stuff you'll have to look at the other output
  and delete the right files (needs some familiarity with the code; a utility
  script to do this might be nice).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration parameters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application uses Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::ConfParser to read and parse the
configuration file and commandline options. It will first read the configuration
file (default.conf or the custom configuration passed in with the --conf
commandline option) and then optionally override these setting with options
passed in on the commandline. It also checks for presence and correct type of
required parameters. Please refer to developer_guide.txt and the Pod in the
ConfParser details for details.

Below is a description of all configuration parameters. Some of it references
more detailed section later in this document. Also look in default.conf in case
this documentation gets out of date/sync.

Base directory:
---------------

  basedir - base directory for all output (which will be in subdirectories of 
            this directory). If it doesn't exist, it will be created.

Logging:
--------

  See section "Logging" below for chosing the right settings.

  loglevel - (optional) controls log verbosity.
             Values (ordered by ascending verbosity): ERROR, WARNING, INFO
             (default), DEBUG

  logpath - (optional) directory for logfiles. Default: '$basedir/log'
  logfile - (optional) log filename

Database connection settings:
-----------------------------

  sourcehost - source db host (e.g. 'ens-livemirror')
  sourceport - source db port (e.g. '3306')
  sourceuser - source db username (e.g. 'ensro' since only read access is
               required for source db)
  sourcepass - source db password (blank for user ensro)
  sourcedbname - source db name (e.g. homo_sapiens_core_48_36j)

  targethost - target db host (e.g. 'ens-staging')
  targetport - target db port (e.g. '3306')
  targetuser - target db username (e.g. '***REMOVED***' since read/write access is
               required for target db)
  targetpass - target db password
  targetdbname - target db name (e.g. homo_sapiens_core_49_36k)

Caching:
--------

  See section "Caching" below for chosing the right settings.

  cache_method - (optional) caching strategy.
                 Values: build_cache_auto (default), build_cache_by_seq_region,
                 build_cache_all

  build_cache_auto_threshold - (optional) max number of toplevel seq_regions
                               before switching to build_cache_all (default:
                               100)

  build_cache_concurrent_jobs - (optional) max number of concurrent LSF jobs
                                when building cache by seq_region (default: 200)

Limit to region:
----------------

  This is mostly useful for code testing and debugging

  region - (optional) only run for this region. Expects same format as returned
           by $slice->name (e.g. chromosome:NCBI36:1:1:2000000:1)
  
  chromosomes - (optional) only run for these chromosomes (comma-separated list)

LSF:
----

  See section "LSF" below for chosing the right settings.

Logging
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three ways of logging:

1. to STDERR:

  if you don't specify any of the log* configuration parameters

2. to a single file:

  use --logfile
  slightly broken (until file locking is implemented)

3. to individual files with autogenerated names:

  use --logauto and --logautobase
