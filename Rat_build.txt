Information about the rat_build for Rnor3.2

 contacts
----------

In doing the rat build the two contacts which are useful for this
build were

Kim Worley from Baylor who was responsible for the assembly
kworley@bcm.tmc.edu

and Susan Bromberg from RGD who I spoke to about markers etc
sbromberg@mail.brc.mcw.edu

Note this was build on branch_25 code for the pipeline and the core but 
head code as of 01/10/04 for ensembl-analysis

Assembly and Sequence
---------------------

The initial agp file was sent by Kim Worley to Ewan. This file though
went through several iterations as problems were found and fixed

The contig sequences so were WGS contigs which could be retrived
from the old rat database. Some were new RNOR identifiers which we
fetched from SRS by searching the description lines of EMBLWGS, lasty there
were some finished clones which could just be pfetched

The chromosome dumps were also fetched from here

ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/analysis/rat/


I took the standard ensembl-pipeline/scripts/load_agp.pl and 
load_seq_region.pl scripts and modified them slightly to load rat
the modified versions can be found in ensembl-personal/lec/rat_scripts

Configuration
-------------

my configuration files you should beable to find under

ensembl-config/rat/rnor_3_2/

there should be a rat_rules.conf and a rat_analysis.conf the 
mapping_conf.pl for xrefs and is you descen the Bio/EnsEMBL tree you
should find any ensembl-pipeline and ensembl-analysis config modules

Analyses
--------

The Following analyses were run as standard and required
no special data or anything other than standard configuration and 
commandline args etc

RepeatMasker (ie was run with -m)
Dust
TRF
Eponine
CPG
tRNAscan
Genscan
Blastgenscans against Uniprot, Unigene and embl_vertrna

Other Raw Computes
------------------

The following raw computes needed data fetching and manipulation
as described below or in specified docs



affy mapping
------------

The affy probe sequence were fetched from here

http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?cat=arrays

I fetched 4 sets of rat probes RG-U34 A-C and  Rat230_2 probes

This site needs registration but it just wants an email address and 
password you don't need to give any other info really

This files were chunked using steves fastasplit program which can be found
~seale/progs/fastasplit/fastasplit. I split them so their would be 
approximately 1000 entries in each file

The code that I used also required the dusted and softmasked sequence 
pushed across the farm so it wasn't executed till all the repeatmasking was
complete

more information about how this runs and the input ids etc needed can be
foundin the doc ensembl-doc/affy_mapping.txt

markers
-------
url for rgd marker ids
http://rgd.mcw.edu/objectSearch/sslpReport.jsp?rgd_id=10075


The process for running markers is desribed in full detail in the document
running_the_markers.txt in ensembl-doc (note at 07/10/04 this didn't
exist yet)

Here is a quick overview of what was required for rat

The UniSTS marker set was got from

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniSTS/UniSTS.sts

The file contains all the markers for every species UniSTS contains 
so you have to grep out your particular species

grep 'Rattus' UniSTS.sts > rat.unists

The unists markers were loaded easily using this script

ensembl-analysis/scripts/markers/load_markers.pl 

the source given was UniSTS and the numeric ids got the source UniSTS_NUM

the RGD markers were slightly more complex. The markers were got from here

ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/data_release/SSLPS

these also had to be grepped for species

grep 'rat' SSLPS.txt > rgd_rat_markers.txt

Then the markers needed to be parsed out into a format which matched  the 
one wanted by the load_markers script

Several of the markers either didn't have primer sequences or didn't
have expected distances and those were skipped. Also some
markers had two primer sequences which given they were all only a base pair
or so different we took the first of each pair as our marker process should
still place them

the script which did this is called

ensembl-personal/lec/rat_scripts/rgd_marker_parse.pl and it outputs a
file called rgd.unists

this can then also be loaded using the load_markers script

the loaded markers are then dumped using the dump_markers.pl script which
can be found in the same location as load_markers.pl


The maps then also need to be loaded

The reports can be downloaded from here

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/UniSTS/UniSTS_MapReports/Rattus_norvegicus/

then name for each of the map files needs to be loaded into the map
table

insert into map (map_name) values('FHH_X_ACI');
insert into map (map_name) values('FHH_x_ACI.7');
insert into map (map_name) values('RH');
insert into map (map_name) values('RH_map.2.2');
insert into map (map_name) values('SHRSP_X_BN');
insert into map (map_name) values('SHRSP_x_BN.7');

The files then need to be parsed and loaded into the marker_map_location 
table

this is done using the script

ensembl-analysis/scripts/markers/load_marker_map_location.pl
