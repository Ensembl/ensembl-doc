Mapping of Ensembl proteins to external databases

I-Purpose
Find the known genes and try to retrieve as much information as possible

II-General strategy 2 different mapping are undertaken 
	   a-Direct mapping of Ensembl peptides against curated databases
	   containing the curated protein for the studied organism. For
	   human we use RefSeq proteins and Human SPTR.
	   
	   b-Secondary mapping (or called X_mapping). This will allow the
	   mapping of the curated database(s) to other databases. For
	   example for human this provides link to HUGO, LocusLink, ...

III-How to run the mapping
	a-First fill in the mapping_conf file, this should be pretty
	straightforward.
	
	b-Run prepare_proteome.pl (perl prepare_proteome.pl), this will
	prepare the fasta file for pmatching

	c-Run get_Xmappin.pl (perl get_Xmapping.pl), this will map the
	curated databases to other databases

	d-Run pmatch.pl: perl pmatch.pl -scd -p perc_id 
			 You have to give the threshold after the -p
			 option. This will be used to cut off under a
			 certain percentage of identity.

	e-Run maps2db.pl (perl maps2db.pl), this will take the result of
	both mappings and load everything into the database.
