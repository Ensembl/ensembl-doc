User documentation (should this go elsewhere?):

Gene descriptions are intended to give rough idea of what the function of a
gene might be; they are generated automatically as follows. EnsEMBL has a
mapping from predicted peptides to a number of databases, SWISSPROT,
SPTREMBL and RefSeq among them. Sometimes to "consortium" databases,
e.g. ZFIN for zebrafish, Anopheles_symbol for anopheles. The
"consortium" file format should match this regexps /^(\S+)\t(.*)$/
(For information on how this mapping is established,see protein.txt)

For each EnsEMBL gene, the mapping to SWISSPROT,SPTREMBL or RefSeq
of the corresponding EnsEMBL peptides is followed, and the SWISSPROT/SPTREMBL/RefSeq
description line is taken as 'the gene description'. 

Since one gene can have many peptides, and since one peptide can map to
several different SWISSPROT, SPTREMBL or RefSeq proteins, some
precedence rules are in place. They are:

 - SWISSPROT takes precedence over RefSeq and SPTREMBL. If there are
   more than one different SWISSPROT proteins for an EnsEMBL gene,
   the best in term %id on query, then %id on target is choosen

 - Ref-Seq takes precedence over SPTREMBL. If there are more than one
   different Ref-Seq proteins for an EnsEMBL gene, the best in term
   %id on Ref-Seq protein (query), then %id on Ensembl gene (target)
   is choosen

 - If there are several SPTREMBL mappings, precedence is established on the
   basis of the occurrence of regular expression patterns in the description
   line. In order of increasing precerence, these patterns currently are:

      unknown hypothetical putative novel probable [0-9]{3} kDa fragment cdna
      protein. 
   
   If after this, two SPTREMBL description lines still have equal
   precedence, the longest description is taken. This precedence list is a
   bit arbitrary, and is bound to be 'tweaked' to get 'better' descriptions
   (see ensembl/misc-scripts/gene-descriptions.pl for the most recent list)

If a "consortium" is given, it precedence over SWISSPROT. (need to
make that more generic so the user can customize the priority order
himself, added in the TODO list)

Maintainer documentation:

Descriptions are taken from "consortium"/SWISSPROT/RefSeq/SPTREMBL.

 - make sure the peptide mapping has been done

 - get hold of the "consortium"/SWISSPROT/RefSeq/SPTREMBL files used
   for the peptide mapping (it can be big and can contain the
   swissprot internal bits, like {} and RefSeq file
   => Protein_database_file(s)

 - assuming ensembl/misc-scripts is in your $PATH, do:

     gene-descriptions.pl -h host -u user -d database -r \
     -r species.regexps -consortium Anopheles_symbol\
     Protein_database_file(s) > gene-descriptions.tab \
     2> gene-descriptions.err

NB: I use to run that under bash. Make sure the > and 2> redirection
work properly under the shell you use.

   This produces the tab-delimited data file (gene-descriptions.tab)
   to be loaded into the gene_description table:

   Have a look at this file; if it contains too much junk  (like the
   2900010M17Rik cruft). If additional filtering is needed, feel free to
   add/modify the species.regexps file, so you get cleaner description. 
   There are some species.regexps files commited in
   ensembl/misc-scripts, e.g. Homo_sapiens.regexps

   Also check in gene-descriptions.err that the species.regexps is not
   too strict and do not throw away nice descriptions...

 - Load gene-descriptions.tab into an Ensembl core database, e.g. as

     gene-descriptions.pl -h host -u user -d database -pXXXX -load gene-descriptions.tab

     you should have write access to the database at this step.
