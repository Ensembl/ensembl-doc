Gene descriptions are intended to give rough idea of what the function of a
gene might be; they are generated automatically as follows. EnsEMBL has a
mapping from predicted peptides to a number of databases, SWISS-PROT and
SP-TrEMBL among them. (For information on how this mapping is established,
see protein.txt)

For each EnsEMBL gene, the mapping to SWISS-PROT or SP-TrEMBL of the
corresponding EnsEMBL peptides is followed, and the SWISS-PROT/SP-TrEMBL
description line is taken as 'the gene description'. 

Since one gene can have many peptides, and since one peptide can map to
several different SWISS-PROT or SP-TrEMBL proteins, some precedence are in
place. They are: 

 - SWISS-PROT takes precedence over SP-TrEMBL. If there are more than one
   different SWISS-PROT proteins for an EnsEMBL gene, the first one
   taken. This may sound arbitrary, but in practice, these descriptions are
   very similar

 - If there are several SP-TrEMBL mappings, precedence is established on the
   bases of the occurrence of regular expression patterns in the description
   line. In order of increasing preference, these patterns currently are:

      unknown hypothetical putative novel probable [0-9]{3} kDa fragment cdna
      protein. 
   
   If the two SP-TrEMBL description lines contain none of these patterns, the
   longest description is taken. This list is a bit arbitrary, and is bound
   to be 'tweaked' to get 'better' descriptions (see
   ensembl/scripts/gene-descriptions.pl for the most recent list)

   We don't (yet) rank the descriptions using the similarity measure used in
   establishing the mapping.

At this stage, there are still many (perhaps half) of the genes without a
description. For these, the consensus description of the family or 'Tribe' to
which they belong are used to are transferred (see family.txt for a
description of the Family database).

Occasionally, peptides from one gene fall into different families. In these
cases, the same ranking as described above for multiple SP-TrEMBL mappings is
used to choose a description.
