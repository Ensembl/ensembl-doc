How to perform SAGE mapping (via LocusLink for known genes and via
UniGene for novel genes) and how to prepare SAGE database (Expression)

DATABASE CORE:

cd /nfs/acari/lh1/src/ensembl-external/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/ExternalData/Expression/sql
mysqladmin -u root create expression110
mysqladmin -u root expression110 < expression.sql
cd ../scripts/mapping_scripts
perl wget.data
perl prepare_txt.pl
mysqlimport -u root expression110 *.txt

also download the BodyMap file

and proceed to:

MAPPING:

Mapping scripts live in:
ensembl-external/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/ExternalData/Expression/scripts/mapping_scripts

a) perl unigene_locuslink_extractor.pl > unigene_locuslink.dat
b) join that with ensp_locuslink.dat mapping (a table from Ensembl
dumped by Arek or Manu) using ELUSmapper.pl to produce ELUSmapper.dat

c) Use perl ENSUmapper.pl for direct mapping
   of Ensembl transcripts to UniGene clusters
   (chromosome names in chr.dat)

d) ENSUpostprocessor.pl     cut-off 300 bits, eliminate UniGenes mapping
                            to more than 15 ENSTs
e) ELUS_ENSUjoiner.pl       join ELUS and ENSU mapping - use ENSU mapping
                            only if there is no ELUS mapping
f) perform script first.pl
g) perform second.pl (one more file from Manu with enst ensg ensp mapping)
h) perform third.pl to prepare seqtag_alias_before_sorting.txt (one more file here called seqtag_id.txt wh
ich is derived from a dump from the expression table seqtag (select * from seqtag into outfile 'name_with_
full_path';); only 1 and 3rd column from this are needed so do cat seqtag.txt | cut -f 1,3 > seqtag_id.txt
 before proceeding to third.pl)
i) sort -un seqtag_alias_before_sorting.txt > seqtag_alias.txt
j) mysqlimport -u root Expressio110 seqtag_alias.txt  

Tests:
ELUS_ENSUtester.pl - compare mapping for known genes (ELUS vs ENUS
mapping)
test_genes         - hand check for my favourite genes
