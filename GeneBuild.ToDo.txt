File for listing all those jobs we want to do but haven't got round to yet.

1. Slim & tidy Combine_Genewises_and_E2Gs.pm (vac, 10.01.2003).
   Rewrite  Combine_Genewises_and_E2Gs.pm:
      rename it
      introduce the methods of TranscriptComparator
      Include also cdna genes as in GeneCombiner
      Ideally: merge GeneCombiner and Combine_Genewises_and_E2Gs.pm into one analysis step
2. Pipeline the GeneBuild (lec 10.01.2003)
3. Make base GeneBuild runnable (lec 10.01.2003)
4. Make transcripts and Prediction transcripts complete transparent (lec 10.01.2003) 
5. Create Transcript evidence table: transcript_id, hit_name, analysis
6. GeneBuilder:
   Introduce the methods of TranscriptComparator
   Refine the hierarchy of transcripts to be chosen to make up the genes
