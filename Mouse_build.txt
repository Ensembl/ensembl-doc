A. Data sources:
----------------

Protein: 
Swissprot mouse set (includes Rikens)

Refseq mouse set

cDNA:
embl-vertrna mouse subset (includes Rikens)

Refseq mouse set

EST:
dbEST mouse entries

B. Problems with past builds:
-----------------------------
Protein mapping: check format of the MRK_* files;
mapping scripts not working correctly due to one of these files
having different columns than expected by script -> problem with
MarkerSymbol's

Missing tmmhmm data from protein annotation stage.
? appeared to run successfully, but failed ?


C. Miscellaneous
----------------

Make sure there is an entry in the meta table for genebuild.version of the form YYMMOrganisation
eg 0402Ensembl
