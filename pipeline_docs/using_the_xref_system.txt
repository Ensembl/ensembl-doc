The most up to date documentation for running the Xrefs pipeline can be found in the Xrefs directory: 
ensembl/misc-scripts/xref_mapping/docs


It contains: 
- a FAQ (FAQ.txt)
- an overview of the process (xrefs_overview.txt)
- a detailled documentation (running_the_xref_pipeline.txt  and xrefs_detailed_docs.txt)
- and some example files  (*.out) 



Before starting, you will need to get a couple of pieces of code:

See
