OrthologueEvalutation : 
=======================

  The OrthologueEvalutation process uses a compara database and several 
  core databases to check if a genebuild contains partial or split genes 
  or if it misses orthologues genes in other species. 
  
  It runs in 2 stages : PRE and POST. 

PRE stage :
=========== 
  
  In the PRE stage three different RunnableDB's (FindPartialGenes,FindSplitGenes 
  and FindMissingOrthologues) query the Compara database to gather data about 
  missing/partial/split genes. The translations of the identified genes / transcripts 
  will be dumped and input-ids for the POST analysis will be uploaded by these 
  runnables into the input_id_table. 
  

POST stage :
=========== 
  
  The post stage uses Exonerte2Genes to make new gene predictions based on the 
  dumped translations.
  
  
  
  
  The setup of the different analysis can be done by a script in  
  
        ensembl-pipeline/scripts/setup_orthologue_evaluator.pl
  
  


How to set up the OrthologueEvaluator-Run 
============================================

   These config files are used by the OrthologueEvaluator Analysis : 

     Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/GeneBuild/OrthologeEvaluator.pm
     Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/GeneBuild/OrthologeEvaluatorExonerate.pm
     Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/GeneBuild/Databases.pm 
     Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/Exonerate2Genes.pm 



Configuration of Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::OrthologeEvaluator : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1) Fill out the MAIN_CONFIG part of the configuration file and flag the analysis
      which you like to run - you can run more than one analysis at one time. Also, 
      set the location of the directory where you like to dump sequences to 
      and add the location of the compara registry file which you've used for the 
      compara computes ( this file holds the data to connect to the different core 
      databases ). The QUERY_SPECIES should be the alias-name of the new genebuild,
      which also needs to have an etry in the compara registry file. 
      An example of a compara registry file can be found in : 

            ensembl/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Utils/ensembl_init.example



       RUN_FIND_SPLIT_GENES          => 0,
       RUN_FIND_PARTIAL_GENES        => 1,
       RUN_FIND__MISSING_ORTHOLOGUES => 1,
       
       SEQUENCE_DUMP_BASE_DIR => "/lustre/work1/ensembl/jhv/project_orth_analysis/seq_dump_cow", 
  
       LOCATION_OF_COMPARA_REGISTRY_FILE =>  '/nfs/acari/jhv/compara_reg.example' , 
       QUERY_SPECIES =>"Canis the_new_dog" ,
 




   2) Than fill out the different configuration parts for each analysis : 

       - If you like to run RUN_FIND_MISSING_ORTHOLOGUES you need to fill out the 
         section FIND_MISSING_ORTHOLOGUES. 

       - If you like to run RUN_FIND_PARTIAL_GENES you need to fill out the 
         section FIND_PARTIAL_GENES .  

       - If you like to run RECOVER_SPLIT_GENES you need to fill out the 
         section RUN_FIND_SPLIT_GENES. 


  
Configuration of Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::Databases: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    1) Configure the output database : ORTHOLOGUE_DB
       in ensembl-analysis/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/GeneBuild/Databases.pm
 
       This will be the database where the Exonerate2Genes runs write their results to. 

        ORTHOLOGUE_DB => {
                           -dbname => 'jhv_fsk_3_41_orth',
                           -host =>   'genebuild6',
                           -port =>   '3306'
                           -user =>   '***REMOVED***',
                           -pass =>   '********',
                         },




Automatic configuration of the setup of the Orthologue-evaluation analyses 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    It will read the configuration out of these modules :

       Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::Databases;
       Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::OrthologueEvaluator;
       Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::OrthologueEvaluatorExonerate; 


     and writes an Exonerte2Genes.pm configuration. The script also adds rules and conditions 
     to your reference database and adds the analysis your reference database - remember, you 
     still need to syncronize the analysis tables of your ref-database with the table in 
     ORTHOLOGUE_DB database. 

     The script also uploads input_id's to run the pre-analysis - these input-ids 
     are slice-names for FIND_MISSING_ORTHOLOGUES and FIND_PARTIAL_GENES, and it's 
     a kind of a dummy-input-id for the FIND_SPLIT_GENES analysis. 

     Note : If you fill out the OrthologueEvaluator.pm configuration file wrong
     and run the setup-script multiple times, you might end up with rule_conditions
     in the rule-table which do not match the modified configurationf-file anymore, 
     so rule-manager will complain about different conditions /  input-id-types. 
     To solve this, it's best to delete all newly added rules and rule-condtions 
     out of the 2 tables and re-run the script. 

     Use these commands in your reference/ pipeline-database : 

        delete from rule_conditions where rule_id > X ; 
        delete from rule_goal where rule_id > X ;  

    Some useful SQL to check the rules in your ref-db : 

      select rg.* , rc.*, logic_name ,a.analysis_id 
      from rule_conditions rc, rule_goal rg , analysis a 
      where rc.rule_id = rg.rule_id 
      and a.analysis_id = rg.goal order by rg.rule_id ; 


    Remember to synchronize the analysis tables before you start the analysis - this 
    command is useful to do this : 

        mysqldump -h host -user ensro  REFERNCE_DB analysis > analysis.sql 
        mysql -h host -u user -pass **** -D ORTHOLOGUE_DB -e 'source analysis.sql' 
 
 
    Before you run the setup-script, make sure that you have the following checkouts in 
    your PERL5LIB. Remember, all checkouts need to be of the same branch as the one's used 
    for the compara run. 

    ensembl
    ensembl-compara 
    ensembl-pipeline
    ensembl-analysis 
    
   The setup script requires some additonal libs :  

       Data::Dumper FindBin  PPI  Clone  List::MoreUtils 

   If you like to install these libs be aware that MoreUtils v. 1.18 is not compatible with 
   Utils v. 1.14. 

   Sanger-internals can add these modules (compiled for linux) to their PERL5LIB by 
   sourcing this file :

                     /nfs/acari/jhv/lib/set_orth_path.sh  
  
   Run setup script to set up the analysis and the input_ids in the reference database and 
   to store rules and conditions. This script also re-writes the Exonerte2Genes config 
   in Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config and backs up your old config - you need to run the setup
   script with the -write option to rewrite the Exonerate2Genes.pm config ( this is for the 
   Exonerate runs in the second stage of the analysis). Your existing Exonerate2Genes-file 
   file will backed up to Exonerate2Genes.pm.bak.0 and there will be a timestamp added 
   in the top when the file has been backed up - Sorry to say but all the comments in your 
   original file can't be transferred to the new file. 

   ATTENTION ! 

   Best is to query the ref-db for the maximum rule-id before you run the 
   automatic setup script, or to back-up your rule tables before running the script : 

       select max(rule_id) from rule_conditions ; 
       select max(rule_id) from rule_goal ; 
       
       create table rg_bak select * from rule_goal ; 
       create table rc_bak select * from rule_conditions ; 

    perl ensembl-pipeline/scripts/setup_orthologue_analysis.pl \
     -dbname <DBNAME> -dbhost <DBHOST> -write 
 


    You can skip the next section because the setup script will fill out the Exonerate2Genes 
    configuration for you and back-up your existing Exonerte2Genes config. 


Manual configuration of Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::Exonerate2Genes: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    
    Read this section ONLY IF you don't use the automatic setup-script. 

    If you want to configure Exonerate2Genes manually, you need an entry for every  
    logic_name used in OrthologeEvaluator.pm-Config - logic_names are the keys of the 
    ANALYSIS_SETS -hash of every section. ( e.g. if you have configuration of an analysis 
    'hum_dog_split' in FIND_SPLIT_GENES-section you need an entry in the Exonerte2Genes
    config which look like this : 

    'hum_dog_split' => {
        'OUTDB' => {
           '-user' => 'user_with_write_priv',
           '-host' => 'dbhost',
           '-dbname' => 'name_of_your_out_db', 
           '-pass' => '*******',
           '-port' => '3306'
         },
      'IIDREGEXP' => '(\\d+):(\\d+)',
      'QUERYSEQS' => '/path/to/where/you/dumped/the/seqs/' , 
      'OPTIONS' => ' --model protein2genome --forwardcoordinates FALSE --softmasktarget TRUE ".
                   " --exhaustive FALSE  --bestn 1',
      'COVERAGE_BY_ALIGNED' => 0,
      'QUERYTYPE' => 'protein'
    },
 

    You need to enter the path to your softmasked genome in the default section of 
    exonerate2genes : 

       'DEFAULT' => {
           'GENOMICSEQS' => '/path/to/softmasked/genome.fa' ,
       }




Configuration of Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::BatchQueue.pm :
------------------------------------------------------------------

 The setup-script configures quite a lot of different analysis - if you don't want to
 them all by hand to BatchQueue.pm,  you can use the default configuration parameters
 in BatchQueue.pm to avoid this step : 


    DEFAULT_RUNNABLEDB_PATH => 'Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/RunnableDB', 
    DEFAULT_CLEANUP         => 'no', 
    DEFAULT_BATCH_QUEUE     => 'normal', 
    DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR      => '/lustre/work1/ensembl/jhv/project_orth_analysis/default_output',
