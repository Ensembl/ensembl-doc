1. Modify LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm and make work and scratch dirs
==
Update your CVS - ensembl, ensembl-pipeline, ensembl-analysis, ensembl-personal, ensembl-compara

YOU WILL NEED A SEPARATE CHECKOUT IF RUNNING 2 LOW-COVERAGE GENOMES AT THE SAME TIME

Modify LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm
  cd $LC_cvsDIR/ensembl-pipeline/scripts/LowCoverage/
  vi LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm
  # fill in all fields, even for files that have not yet been created 
  # eg. analysis.conf, rule.conf, ab_initio.lib, supplemental.lib.  

Make directories listed in LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm
  mkdir $LC_workDIR
  mkdir $LC_scratchDIR
  mkdir -p /ensembl-config/$LC_SPECIES/$LC_BUILD_VERSION 
      
The script will make config files for you at a later stage.


2. Downloading assembly from BROAD
==
Find work space for the assembly  
  mkdir $LC_workDIR/assembly (specified in LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm)
  cd $LC_workDIR/assembly
  df -h $LC_workDIR/ (to check enough space on disk - need at least 5G)

Navigate to your species
  ~/ncftp-3.1.7/bin/ncftp ftp://ftp.broad.mit.edu/pub/assemblies/mammals/$LC_SPECIES/
  mget *

Unzip files   
  gzip -d assembly.bases.gz
  gzip -d Draft_v1.agp.chromosome.fasta.gz
Note: There may not be a file named Draft_v1.agp.chromosome.fasta.gz. This file has had the following names in other organisms:
      assembly.agp.fasta.gz (in elephant)
      scaffolds.fasta.gz (in armadillo and rabbit) 
      Draft_v1.agp.chromosome.fasta.gz (in tenrec, bushbaby, microbat and common shrew).

Make sure that you have these files:
  assembly.bases                                = fasta file of contigs
  assembly.agp                                  = contig->scaffold
  Draft_v1.agp.chromosome.fasta (or equivalent) = Broad's assembled sequence

You will also need to look at BasicAssemblyOneLiner (preferred over BasicStats) to get information for the website. eg. N50.


3.Run setup
==
This does a number of things in the following order:

a. Copy the required config files to /ensembl-config/$LC_SPECIES/$LC_BUILD_VERSION
   Files copied are: /Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/Blast.pm
                     /Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/General.pm
		     /Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config/BatchQueue.pm
		     /Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config/General.pm
		     /pipe_conf/analysis.conf
		     /pipe_conf/rules.conf

b. Create database $LC_DBNAME

c. load_seq_region (-coord_system_name contig -rank 2 -fasta_file assembly.bases) #loads into dna and seq_region

d. load_seq_region (-coord_system_name scaffold -rank 1 -agp_file assembly.agp)   #loads into dna and seq_region

e. Populates meta table with assembly, genebuild and taxonomy info 

f. load_agp                                                                       #loads into assembly

g. set_toplevel                                                                   #loads into seq_region_attrib

h. analysis_setup                                                                 #loads into analysis

i. rule_setup                                                                     #loads into rule_goal, rule_conditions

j. load_analysis_descriptions                                                     #loads into analysis_description   

k. make_input_ids                                                                 #loads into input_id_analysis 


When the script copies your config files to ensembl config, these config files will contain global variables. It is probably a good idea to replace these variables with hard-coded names. The files that will need some work are:
  /Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config/BatchQueue.pm: 
    #  resource   => 'select[linux && my$LC_DBHOST<800] rusage[my$LC_DBHOST=10:duration=10:decay=1]',
    #  DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR  => $LC_scratchDIR."/raw_computes/",
  /Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config/General.pm:  
    #  PIPELINE_REPEAT_MASKING => $LC_REPMASK_CHOICE,

Along the way, some db queries are made and printed to STDERR. You should have a look at the output and see if it looks right.

NB: Setup cannot be run in the background as it requires user-interaction. ie. At certain steps it will ask the user if it should continue or not: 
- before creating the db
- between load_agp and set_toplevel


4. Downloading repeat libraries from EBI:	
==
As this is a new organism, there may not be a repeat library available.

If a repeat library has been made, it can be found and downloaded from here:
  cd $LC_workDIR
  mkdir repeat_libraries
  cd repeat_libraries
  ~/ncftp-3.1.7/bin/ncftp ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/repeat_libraries
  cd $LC_SPECIES
  mget *


If there is no repeat library here, you will need to email Damian Keefe and ask him to make you a repeat library. When you email him, you will need to give him the location of a fasta file containing all non-redundant genome sequence ie  top-level 
This can be made by doing:
  /ensembl-personal/searle/scripts/fetch_slice_seq.pl \
  -host $LC_DBPORT -user ensro -port 3306 -dbname $LC_DBNAME -path  $LC_DEFAULT \
  -all -outfile /path/to/toplevel_unmasked/toplevel_unmasked.fa

Or, if you prefer:
  perl /ensembl-analysis/scripts/sequence_dump.pl -dbuser xxxxxxxx -dbpass xxxxxxx \
  -dbport 3306 -dbhost $LC_DBPORT -dbname $LC_DBNAME \
  -coord_system_name toplevel -onefile \
  -output_dir /path/to/toplevel_unmasked


Check that the path to your repeat libraries are correct in LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm: 
  LC_AB_INITIO_LIB  
  LC_SUPP_LIB


5.  Run check_seqs
==
This takes two scaffolds and checks that the sequences in the database correspond to the correct sequence in the
fasta file. It is possible that the headers in your fasta files are strange and will not be parsed, in which case you'll have to fiddle. 

Headers like this should be OK: 
  scaffold_127890.1-7726 (Draft_v1)

The regular expression used is:
  ?-xism:^>(scaffold_127890[^0-9]+)\s+.*$

Another way to check that things have been loaded correctly is to compare your entire toplevel_unmasked.fa (See 4. Downloading repeat libraries from EBI) against the entire scaffolds file (Draft_v1.agp.chromosome.fasta). 


6.  Run run_RepeatMask_and_independent
==
Sets off the rulemanager for:
RepeatMask
Supp_RepeatMask
Ab_initio_RepeatMask
Eponine
CpG
Dust
TRF
tRNAscan 

You might prefer to run the rulemanager outside of the script.

Don't forget to test_RunnableDB!


7.  Run compare
==
Runs the repeat-types script.

Examines the repeat coverage from each of the three RepeatMask analyses (RepeatMask, Supp_RepeatMask, Ab_initio_RepeatMask).
You will need to decide which of these RepeatMasks combinations you want to use.

It's usually fine to use Repeatmask and Supp_RepeatMask together.

Don't forget to fill in your $LC_REPMASK_CHOICE in LowCoverageGeneBuildConf.pm .


8.  Run run_RepeatMask_dependent
==
Sets off the rulemanager for:
Genscan
Uniprot
Unigene
Vertrna

Note that all genscans must run first before the other analyses can be started.

You might prefer to run the rulemanager outside of the script.

You first need to test each of these analyses before you run the rulemanager, an explanation of how to do this is printed
to STDERR by the script.


9.  Run dump_RepeatMasked_sequence
==
This step can be performed now or at a later date. It will submit a job to LSF for making the repeatmasked dusted genomic sequence that should eventually be pushed to /data/blastdb/Ensembl/ .

It is a good idea to check that all sequences are in this file.

Email isg-help to request the pushing of this file.


10. Run healthcheck
==
First you need to check that your database.properties is pointing to the correct host
and that ensj-healthcheck/src/org/ensembl/healthcheck/Species.java contains your species.

This step must be run from within $LC_cvsDIR/ensj-healthcheck directory

Backup your database before making any changes (see 11.)


The script does not automatically fill in species.ensembl_names in the meta table so you will need to do this manually.
  insert into meta(meta_key,meta_value) values ('species.ensembl_common_name','xxx')
  insert into meta(meta_key,meta_value) values ('species.ensembl_alias_name','xxx')

Look here for the ensembl_common_name:
  mysql -uensro -hecs2 -P3365 -Dncbi_taxonomy -e "select name from ncbi_taxa_name where \
    name_class = 'genbank common name' and taxon_id = xxx"

Look here for the ensembl_alias_name: 
  http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/public-plugins/ensembl/conf/SiteDefs.pm?view=markup&root=ensembl
  public-plugins/ensembl/conf/SiteDefs.pm


The script does not automatically fill in repeat.analyses in the meta table so you will need to do this manually.
The repeat.analysis refers to which repeats we have run.
  insert into meta (meta_key,meta_value) values ('repeat.analysis','Dust')"
  insert into meta (meta_key,meta_value) values ('repeat.analysis','RepeatMask')"
  insert into meta (meta_key,meta_value) values ('repeat.analysis','Supp_RepeatMask')"
  insert into meta (meta_key,meta_value) values ('repeat.analysis','TRF')"


Common fixes which need to be made include:
 delete from repeat_feature where repeat_start < 1   #provided there aren't too many

  delete simple_feature.* from simple_feature, seq_region where simple_feature.seq_region_end \
   > seq_region.length and seq_region.seq_region_id=simple_feature.seq_region_id   #provided there aren't too many


After changes rerun the healthchecks.


11. Run backup
==
This will make a backup of your database using mysqldump -T

You may prefer to do this manually:
  mysqldump -h$LC_DBHOST -u$LC_DBUSER -p$LC_DBPASS -P3306 $LC_DBNAME -T /tmp/dir/


12. Run clean
==
This step is rather slow but removes contents of assembly, repeat libraries and raw_compute directories plus
it removes seqdump and repeatmask_dependents.out and repeatmasking.out too


You may like to hold off running this step for a while in case you need to consult your output dirs.


13. Finishing off
==
You need to make a copy of your database called _pre instead of _ref (eg sd3_rabbit_1_pre)
In _pre database you need to make the following changes:
  drop table job;
  drop table job_status;
  drop table rule_goal;
  drop table rule_conditions;
  drop table input_id_analysis;
  drop table input_id_type_analysis;  
  delete from analysis where logic_name = 'SubmitContig';

You then need to run the healthchecks for this database eg:
  ./run-healthcheck.sh -output info -d sd3_rabbit_1_pre -type core -species rabbit post_genebuild > & \
  $ENSTEN/healthchecks/thirdrun_info.out

and prepare a little write up for http://pre.ensembl.org/index.html
you can copy this from Elephant and insert the appropriate stats 
you'll find these in your assembly/BasicAssemblyOneLiner.out
the numbers you need are:

super_n50_gap          ( = N50 length for supercontigs) 
contig_N50             ( = N50 length for contigs) 
total_super_length     ( = total number of bases in supercontigs) 
total_contig_length    ( = total number of bases in contigs)

eg rabbit:
super_n50_gap          = 54.49Kb 
contig_N50             = 3.18Kb
total_super_length     = 3.45Gb 
total_contig_length    = 2.08Gb

Now you're ready to handover the _pre database, healthchecks with comments and the write up.
