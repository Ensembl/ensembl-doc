TranscriptConsensus
===================

Transcript consensus attempts to find the most supported transcript(s) from a cluster.
It works by collapsing the cluster into a non redundant set of introns and exons which are then assigned a score 
based on how may identical features were collapsed compared to how many non identical features the collapsed feature 
overlaps.
It was designed to be used after the similarity genebuild and EST / cDNA alignments have been run and needs a large 
number of transcripts to run on.

It is an extension of TranscriptCoalescer and so uses the same configuration files to determine
which gene sets to use and which databases to get them from:
Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::Databases.pm
Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::TranscriptCoalescer.pm

In addition it has it's own configuration file:
Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::TranscriptConsensus.pm

The Module may be used to add UTR to the genes if required, using whichever dna set you have chosen (cDNAs, ESTs).
The added UTR is scored in the same way as the coding exons and so contributes to the overall  transcript score, UTR 
may also be down-weighted so that genes with UTR score less well, and so are filtered out unless there is a lot of 
evidence for the UTR.


Example configuration:
######################

  FILTER_SINGLETONS => 0,
  FILTER_NON_CONSENSUS => 0,
  FILTER_ESTS       => 0,
Pre-filtering - this is run before the clustering to remove genes with unsupported exons (singletons) or genes with 
non-consensus splice sites, the numbers chosen in the config are the maximum number to tolerate before the transcript is filtered, here they are all 0 so the filtering is turned off.
This is an aggressive approach, and can often filter out useful things, however sometimes it is very useful for 
untangling clusters that have become joined.
  
  

  ADD_UTR => 1,
This will prevent addition of UTR if set to zero, ESTs / cDNAs can still be used to help improve the scoring even if 
they are not used to add UTR.
  

  MIN_CONSENSUS => 4,
  
For clusters with veryu few transcripts the scoring is ineffective and so this option lets you ignore small clusters 
In this case all the transcripts are written to the final database.
  

  UTR_PENALTY => 0.1,
  
Make UTR addition more or less conservative 0 = neutral 1 = never add UTR
  
  # penalty to stop "spindly" exons
  END_EXON_PENALTY => 0.3,
  
 This penalty is designed to stop "spindly" exons where the transcripts is over extended
  

  EST_OVERLAP_PENALTY => 0.1,
  
This penalises internal exons that overlap an EST / cDNA transcript but not an exon
  
  SHORT_INTRON_PENALTY => 10,  
  SHORT_EXON_PENALTY => 10,     
This is a penalty for short exons and introns, ( lots of little exons can artificially inflate a transcripts score ).
  
  GOOD_PERCENT  => 0,
This defines how many transcripts we wish to keep, i.e.:
 0 = only the highest scoring transcript / transcripts
 2 = the top 2% highest scoring transcripts
 100 = all possible transcripts.
