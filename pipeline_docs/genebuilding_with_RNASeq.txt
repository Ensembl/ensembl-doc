Genebuilding with RNA-Seq
*************************

This is a document aiming to explain how to use ensembl code to build gene models from paired end RNA-Seq data

What you will need
==================
We need several sets of perl code in order to run. These
are all freely available via CVS (see overview.txt).

These are required

ensembl
ensembl-pipeline
ensembl-analysis
ensembl-personal
ensembl-doc ( "helpful" documentation )

you also need bioperl which is again freely available

bioperl-live (bioperl-release-1-2-3)

This document assumes familiarity with the Ensembl pipeline system, for further documentation detailing pipeline set up and use see ensembl-doc.

We currently run genomic alignments of the reads using BWA - Li H. and Durbin R. (2009) Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Bioinformatics, 25:1754-60. [PMID: 19451168]
We use samtools for alignment processing - Li H.*, Handsaker B.*, Wysoker A., Fennell T., Ruan J., Homer N., Marth G., Abecasis G., Durbin R. and 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup (2009) The Sequence alignment/map (SAM) format and SAMtools. Bioinformatics, 25, 2078-9. [PMID: 19505943]
We use Exonerate for aligning split reads ( introns ) http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/

The pipeline consists of 4 main steps and 1 QC step.
1. Aligning the reads to the genome (BWA)
2. Building "rough" transcript structures from the aligned reads (Bam2Genes module)
3. Making intron features using Exonerate (Bam2Introns module)
4. Combining the intron features with the "rough" transcripts to build refined gene models. (RefineSolexaGenes module)
5. (optional) Alignment of the predicted open reading frames to a BLAST database ie: Uniprot (BlastRNA-SeqPep module)


1. Aligning to the genome
==========================

BWA can be run as part of the ensembl pipeline. There is a document explaining how the pipeline can be automatically configured: ensembl-analysis/Scripts/RNASeq/README
First you need to dump the sequence of your genome without using the ensembl style headers ie: use 1 or chr1 rather than chromosome:ZV9:1:1:1999999:1 this is because the
colons used in the ensembl style header are special characters in SAM format headers.
Next you need to index the genome flat file using BWA something like:
bwa index /path/to/my/genome_file.fa

The pipeline is configured from a tab deliminated flat file detailing the file names and meta data associated with the sequencing run.
The pipeline is run using the rulemanager and the lanes are aligned using BWA.

Remeber - all this is performed by the pipeline modules BWA and BWA2BAM which are auto configured using the setup_rnaseq_pipeline.pl script in  ensembl-analysis/Scripts/RNASeq

BWA command line for reference:
bwa aln -n 50 -i 100 -f  alignment_1.sai /path/to/my/genome_file.fa /path/to/my/fastq_1.fastq
bwa aln -n 50 -i 100 -f  alignment_2.sai /path/to/my/genome_file.fa /path/to/my/fastq_2.fastq

In this case we are aligning 100bp reads the -i 100 means do not allow indels anywhere in the alignment the -n 50 is allow up to half the alignment to be miss matched, this
is so we can align reads that are split over exon boundaries.

Then the alignments are paired and the results written out into BAM format, 

sampe command line:
bwa sampe -A -a 200000 -f  paired_alignment.sam /path/to/my/genome_file.fa alignment_1.sai  alignment_2.sai /path/to/my/fastq_1.fastq /path/to/my/fastq_2.fastq

BAM files are created from the SAM format using samtools, ie:

samtools view command line:
samtools view -S -b paired_alignment.sam  -o  alignment.bam

the BAM file is sorted indexed and multiple bam files may be merged
samtools sort and index commands:
samtools sort alignment.bam   alignment_sorted
samtools merge pooled_PE.bam alignment_PE_sorted_lane_1.bam alignment_PE_sorted_lane_2.bam alignment_PE_sorted_lane_3.bam
samtools index pooled_PE.bam

This gives us one large sorted indexed BAM file that is the basis of all the downstream analysis.
All this is performed by the pipeline modules BWA and BWA2BAM which are auto configured using the 

2. Building Rough transcripts
==============================


Next we run Bam2Genes to make rough models
Here is some example configuration that can be used to set up the analyses
Analysis config:

[SubmitChromosome]
input_id_type=CHROMOSOME

[bam2genes]
module=Bam2Genes
input_id_type=CHROMOSOME

[bam2introns]
module=Bam2Introns
input_id_type=STABLEID
program=exonerate-0.9.0
program_file=/usr/local/ensembl/bin/exonerate-0.9.0

[SubmitBam2Introns]
input_id_type=STABLEID

[sam2bam]
module=Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::Sam2Bam
program=samtools
program_file=/software/solexa/bin/samtools
input_id_type=GENOME

[submit_sam2bam]
module=DUMMY
input_id_type=GENOME

[refine_genes]
module=Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::RefineSolexaGenes
input_id_type=CHROMOSOME

[RNA-SeqBlast]
db=BlastDB
db_file=/path/to/my/BlastDB
program=wublastp
program_file=wublastp
parameters=-cpus => 1, -hitdist => 40
module=BlastRNA-SeqPep
gff_source=wublastp
gff_feature=similarity
input_id_type=CHROMOSOME



Rules config:
[bam2genes]
condition=SubmitChromosome
[bam2introns]
condition=SubmitBam2Introns
[sam2bam]
condition=submit_sam2bam
[refine_genes]
condition=SubmitChromosome
[RNA-SeqBlast]
condition=SubmitChromosome

These config are loaded into the pipeline databases using scripts found in ensembl-pipeline/Scripts

# analyses
  perl ensembl-pipeline/analysis_setup.pl -dbname my_pipeline_db -dbuser admin -pass password -port 3306 -read -file RNA-Seq_analysis.conf
# rules
  perl ensembl-pipeline/rule_setup.pl  -dbname my_pipeline_db -dbuser admin -pass password -port 3306   -read -file RNA-Seq_rules.conf

Once the pipeline and output databases are set up you need to configure the module; this can be based on the example config in:
/ensembl-analysis/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/GeneBuild/Bam2Genes.pm.example

A typical config would look like this:

package Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::Bam2Genes;

use strict;
use vars qw( %Config );

# Hash containing config info
%Config = (

BAM2GENES_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC =>
    {
     DEFAULT => {
                 # databases are defined as hash keys from Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::Databases
                 OUTPUT_DB    => '',
                 
                 # location of sorted and indexed bam file containing genomic alignments
                 ALIGNMENT_BAM_FILE => '',
                 
                 # logic_name for repeats will be used to merge exons separated by repeats

                 # leave blank if you don't want to fill in the gaps ( shouldn't be needed  with BWA anyway )
                 REPEAT_LN  => '',

                 # options for filtering out small gene models
                 MIN_LENGTH => 300,
                 MIN_EXONS  =>   1,
                 
                 # we need to remove the 1 or 2 tag from the end of the paired read names so
                 # we can pair them by name, this regex will usually work but if you have
                 # reads with differently structured headers you may need to tweak it
                 PAIRING_REGEX => '_\d',
                 
                 #?genes with a span < MIN_SPAN will also be considered single exon
                 MIN_SINGLE_EXON_LENGTH => 1000,
                 
                 # 'span' = genomic extent / cdna length
                 MIN_SPAN   =>   1.5,
                 
                 },
       bam2genes => {
                     OUTPUT_DB    => 'ROUGH_MODELS',
                         ALIGNMENT_BAM_FILE => '/path/to/my/sorted/indexed/bam_file.bam',
                     },
    }
);

Starting the pipeline should result in writing transcript models into your output database.

3. Making Intron features
=========================
In order to make the intron alignments it is first necessary to give stable ids to your rough models this can be done thus:
mysql -u admin -ppassword -h database_instance -P3306 -D"rough_models" -e"\
truncate table gene_stable_id; truncate table transcript_stable_id; truncate table exon_stable_id;\
insert into gene_stable_id select gene_id, concat( 'BAMG',lpad(gene_id,11,'0')), 0, now(),now() from gene;\
insert into transcript_stable_id select transcript_id, concat( 'BAMT',lpad(transcript_id,11,'0')), 0, now(),now() from transcript;\
insert into exon_stable_id select exon_id, concat( 'BAME',lpad(exon_id,11,'0')), 0, now(),now() from exon;"

These are used as input ids for the next stage - the input ids can be made in this way:
mysql -N -u admin -ppassword -h database_instance -P3306 -D"rough_models"   -e"\
select 'INSERT INTO input_id_analysis values(@',stable_id,'@,@STABLEID@,X,now(),@@,@@,0);' from gene_stable_id;" \
| sed 's/@/"/g' | sed 's/\t//g' > intron_iids.sql

mysql -N -u admin -ppassword -h database_instance -P3306 -D"rough_models"  < $BUILD/intron_iids.sql

NOTE: the X in the first line "@STABLEID@,X,now()" should be replaced with the analysis_id of the Bam2Introns module.

This module works by selecting partially aligned reads from the bam file and realining then against the sequence of the rough model or the genomic range covered by the model,
the realignment is preformed using Exonerate with a shorter word length and the est2genome splice model.
The realignment needs to be perfomed using a specific read length so if your BAM file contains a mixture of read lengths you should run multiple analyses, one for each
length.

A typical config would look like this:
package Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::Bam2Introns;

use strict;
use vars qw( %Config );

%Config = (

 BAM2INTRONS_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC =>  {
           DEFAULT =>  {
            ##############################################
            # You can write out the alignments in SAM / BAM format
        # specify the path to an output directory here
        # files will be created as input_id.sam - overrides the output db(s)
        OUT_SAM_DIR => '/path/to/output/directory',   
        # dont allow more then X % missmatches ie a number of 6%  = 2 missmatches on a 35 bp read
        # and 4 missmatches on a 75 bp read etc..
        MISSMATCH => 6,
            # Database to fetch the trancripts from
            TRANSDB => 'ROUGH_DB',
        # Loaction of BAM file containg the genomic alignments
        BAM_FILE  => '/path/to/bam/sw4/file/pooled_PE.bam',
        # Exonerate word length, smaller = more accurate takes longer
        WORD_LENGTH => '10 ',
        # repeat masks the transcript sequences - quick but you might miss something
        MASK => '0',
        # length of the reads to fetch
        READ_LENGTH => '100',
        # use the full genomic sequence rather than just the transcript sequence
        FULLSEQ   => 1,
        # maximum (genomic) length roughmodel for using fullseq, any larger and it will switch
        # to transcript seq to save CPU and mem
        MAX_TRANSCRIPT => 1000000,
        # number of reads to align in each batch
        BATCH_SIZE => 100000,
               },
   bam2introns =>{},
    }

Once the rulemanager has finished there should be a large directory structure within the output directory that contains SAM files for each of the rough models that produced
results. The Sam2Bam module will tidy these files up into one large BAM file and will warn if there were any failures during the previous run. Failures can ususaly be
resolved by rerunning the specific jobs that failed.

A sample config for Sam2Bam
package Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::Sam2Bam;

use strict;
use vars qw( %Config );

%Config = (
 SAM2BAM_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC =>  {
           DEFAULT =>  {
         # directory containing the sam file(s)
         SAM_DIR => '/path/to/output/directory',
         # path to the bam file to produce as output
         BAMFILE => '/path/to/output/bam/introns.sam',
         # regex to identify which SAM files to merge
         REGEX => '.sam',
         # path to dumped genome file used for the alignment
         # it will make an index for it if one does not already exist
         GENOMEFILE => '/path/to/my/genome_file.fa',
           },    
       sam2bam => {},
    }

4. Building Refined genes
==========================

Once the BAM file containing introns is complete the next stage is to combine the introns and exons from the rough models in a combinatorial way to create finished
transcripts with CDS. The RefineSolexaGenes module performs this task.
Here is an example config file
package Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::RefineSolexaGenes;

use strict;
use vars qw( %Config );

# Hash containing config info
%Config = (

        REFINESOLEXAGENES_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC =>
          {
           DEFAULT => {
               # databases are defined as hash keys from Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::Databases
                       OUTPUT_DB => 'REFINED_DB',
           INTRON_DB => '',
           MODEL_DB  => 'ROUGH_DB',
           

           # Using bam file to fetch intron features overrides the INTRON_DB
                   INTRON_BAM_FILE => '/path/to/my/intron/BAM/introns_sorted.bam',

           # write the intron features into the OUTPUT_DB along with the models
           WRITE_INTRONS => 1,
           
           # maximum number of times to loop when building all possible paths through the transcript
           MAX_RECURSIONS => 100000,
                       
           # analysis logic_name for the dna_align_features to fetch from the INTRON_DB
           # If left blank all features will be fetched
           LOGICNAME => [],
           
           # logic name of the gene models to fetch
           MODEL_LN  => '',
           
           # penalty for removing a retined intron
           RETAINED_INTRON_PENALTY => 2,
           
           # minimum size for an intron
           MIN_INTRON_SIZE  => 30,   
           
           # biotype to give to single exon models if left blank single exons are ignored
           SINGLE_EXON_MODEL => 'single_exon',
       
           # minimum single exon size (bp)
           MIN_SINGLE_EXON => 1000,
       
           # minimum percentage of single exon length that is coding
           SINGLE_EXON_CDS => 66,
           
           # Intron with most support determines the splice sites for an internal exon
           # lower scoring introns with different splice sites are rejected
           
           STRICT_INTERNAL_SPLICE_SITES => 1,
           
           # In some species alternate splice sites for end exons seem to be common
           STRICT_INTERNAL_END_EXON_SPLICE_SITES => 1,
           
           # biotypes to give gene models if left blank these models will not get written to the output database
           # best score - model with most supporting intron features
           BEST_SCORE => 'best',
           # all other possible models
           OTHER_ISOFORMS => '',
                       # max number of other models to make - blank = all
           OTHER_NUM      => '10',
           
                       # max number of other models to process - blank = all
           MAX_NUM      => '1000',
           
           # biotype to label bad models ( otherwise they are not written )
           BAD_MODELS     => '',
                  },
       refine_genes => {},
       }
       
);

The module will produce a configurable number of transcripts per loci, here it is configured to output the single highest scoring transcript per loci.
The WRITE_INTRONS variable enables the intron features to be written to the output database as dna_align_features with a score that represents the number of reads that splice
in that way, these can be useful for visualisation and analysis of the models.

5. Alignment of the predicted open reading frames to a BLAST database ie: Uniprot (BlastRNA-SeqPep module)
=========================================================================================================

This module is a QC step that takes the sequence of the RNA-Seq transcripts and blasts them against an WASHU formatted protein blast db of your choice, I use Uniprot PE 1 and 2
proteins. You also need to index the protein sequences used in the BLASTDB using indicate.
The resulting hits are processed and stored as transcript supporting protein align features, the hcoverage field represents the % coverage of the target protein ( in
this case Uniprot) by the RNA-Seq open reading frame (ORF)and the %ID value is replaced by the % coverage of the RNA-Seq ORF by the target.
Here is an example config:
package Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::BlastRNA-SeqPep;

use strict;
use vars qw( %Config );

# Hash containing config info
%Config = (

        BLASTRNA-SeqPEP_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC =>
          {
           DEFAULT => {
               # databases are defined as hash keys from Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::Databases
                       OUTPUT_DB => 'REFINED_UNIPROT',
           MODEL_DB  => 'REFINED_DB',
           
           # If left blank all refined genes will be fetched
           LOGICNAME => '',
           
           # path to index to fetch the sequence of the blast hit to calculate % coverage
           INDEX => '/path/to/my/protein/index/index',
                },
       RNA-SeqBlast => {},
       }
       
);

Filtering the RNA-Seq models based on the percentage coverage should help clean up the final gene set for use in a genebuild.
